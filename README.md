# ECG_Signal_Classification
Two-part project that involves detecting the R-peaks in an ECG signal to extract the individual ECG beats and making a machine learning model to classify them. Both extract data from .csv files and can be found in their respective folders.

## Part 1
Here, I parse data from a .csv file, discard incomplete rows with missing information, plot the data, and isolate the R-peaks

## Part 2
Here, I parse data from multiple .csv files containing different dimensions of the data. I then apply three classifiers: KNearestNeighbors, DecisionTree, and RandomForest; and then compare and contrast the results.
